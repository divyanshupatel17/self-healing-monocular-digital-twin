Project Roadmap: Self-Healing Monocular Digital Twins via 3D Gaussian Splatting

Phase 1: Foundation & Prototype (Current 30% Scope)
Goal: Establish the pipeline, handle data, and create a functional but simplified Digital Twin representation.

1. Data Pipeline
- Dataset: KITTI Odometry (Sequence 00/01).
- Functionality: Loading images (Color/Grayscale), reading camera calibration matrices.
- Output: Stream of ordered frames.

2. Monocular Visual Odometry (VO) Legacy
- Method: Classical Geometry (OpenCV).
- Technique: FAST/ORB Feature Detection + Lucas-Kanade Optical Flow.
- Pose Estimation: 5-Point Algorithm (findEssentialMat) + Recover Pose.
- Mapping: Sparse 3D Point Cloud generation via Triangulation.
- Status: Basic tracking, drift expected.

3. Digital Twin Representation
- Concept: Converting sparse point clouds into 3D Gaussian Primitive objects.
- Attributes: Mean (XYZ), Color (Image intensity), Variance (Scale placeholder).
- Rendering: Simple projection logic for visualization.

4. Basic Self-Healing
- Mechanism: Keep-Alive logic.
- Trigger: Significant loss of tracked visual features (simulated occlusion).
- Action: Predict next system state using Constant Velocity Model (Dead Reckoning) to fill gaps in tracking.

Phase 2: Advanced Representation & Optimization (Next 40%)
Goal: Upgrade the representation to true 3D Gaussian Splatting and improve VO stability.

1. True 3D Gaussian Splatting
- Upgrade: Replace Python-object Gaussians with CUDA-optimized Gaussian Kernels.
- Rendering: Real-time rasterization using specific splatting libraries.
- Optimization: Differentiable training loop to refine Gaussian parameters based on reprojection error.

2. Dense Mapping
- Upgrade: Move from Sparse Features to Semi-Dense or Dense Depth Maps.
- Technique: Multi-View Stereo (MVS) or Depth-from-Motion integration.

3. Loop Closure & Optimization
- Upgrade: Implement Backend Optimization (g2o / GTSAM).
- Feature: Detect when the vehicle returns to a known location and correct cumulative drift.

Phase 3: AI-Driven Self-Healing & Deployment (Final 30%)
Goal: Replace classical assumptions with Deep Learning for robust failure recovery.

1. Neural Self-Healing
- Upgrade: Replace Constant Velocity Model with a Generative AI Model.
- Technique: NeRF or Diffusion-based in-painting to reconstruct missing parts of the Digital Twin when the camera is blocked.

2. Deep Visual Odometry
- Upgrade: Replace OpenCV features with Deep Features (SuperPoint) or End-to-End VO.

3. Edge Deployment
- Goal: Optimization for hardware like NVIDIA Jetson.
- Technique: Model compression, TensorRT optimization.
