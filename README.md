# Self-Healing Monocular Digital Twin

A research-oriented project that builds a monocular visual perception pipeline capable of maintaining a digital twin of the environment under sensor degradation.

## Phase 1 – Foundation
- Monocular Visual Odometry on KITTI Odometry
- Sparse digital twin construction
- Self-healing via dead-reckoning during visual failure
- Ground-truth trajectory comparison

## Tech Stack
Python · OpenCV · NumPy · KITTI Dataset

## Roadmap
Phase 2: True 3D Gaussian Splatting  
Phase 3: AI-driven self-healing & edge deployment
